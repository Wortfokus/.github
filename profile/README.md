# Wortfokus

This is the official Github Account which hosts all the code for Wortfokus.
The goal was to reach out to more people and spread the word of god also to them.

We develop digital applications to support and inspire Christians in their daily lives.  
Our goal is to create meaningful, faith-centered tools that help people grow spiritually, engage with the Bible, and share the Gospel in creative ways.
